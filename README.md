# Obsidian Vim Yank Highlight Plugin

Highlight yanked text seamlessly in Obsidian Vim mode with a subtle animation you've missed so much.

## Why?

The Vim mode in CodeMirror [lacks native support for highlighting yanked text](https://github.com/replit/codemirror-vim/issues/121). This plugin addresses the gap in Obsidian.

## Features

-   Make the yanked region apparent!
